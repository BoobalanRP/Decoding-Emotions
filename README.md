# Decoding Emotions through Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Conversations

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the emotions expressed in social media conversations using sentiment analysis. By analyzing the sentiment of textual data from social media posts, this project seeks to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The project leverages a dataset called **Sentiment140** which contains tweets labeled with their sentiment. The main goal is to develop a web application that allows users to submit text, and based on sentiment analysis, receive real-time feedback regarding the sentiment of the input text, along with a graphical visualization of the sentiment distribution.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications.
- **TextBlob**: A Python library for processing textual data and performing sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library used to create sentiment distribution visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end of the web application.
- **Sentiment140 Dataset**: A dataset of tweets labeled with sentiments, used to train the sentiment analysis model.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text input from users and categorizes it as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."
- **Real-time Visualization**: Displays a bar chart of sentiment distribution based on the userâ€™s input, showing the confidence of the sentiment classification.
- **Web Interface**: A simple, user-friendly web interface where users can submit text for sentiment analysis.
